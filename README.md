Getting started
---------------

The first time after cloning the repository, create the virtualenv:

    $ virtualenv -p python3 venv

Then enter the virtual environment (you'll need to do this in any fresh
shell before running the application or using pip):

    $ . venv/bin/activate

And finally, install the required packages:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
